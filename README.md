# Plans for integration.
The HTML elements should be able to be copy-pasted into whatever.
The JQuery code for the HTML elements are in httpsender.js, which can probably also be copy-pasted over.

Currently, displaycanvas.js is just a stub thing.
We call its init() function to start it up,
and then we call its receiveData() function to send data into it.
These functions are just placeholders, and I'm open to changing the code to support different canvas procedures.

# Suggestions?
Please let me know. I have no idea what I'm doing.
